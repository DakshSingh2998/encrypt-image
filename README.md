Just choose 1 for encrytion and 0 for decryption.
Then give the full path to you file
It will generate 2 files, one is without extension which is encrypted image,
second is encryption key of same bytes with .dd extension
To decrypt give full path to encrypted file (without extension), it will generate original image with .jpg extension
